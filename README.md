## Example queries

! Most of the queries don't work due to reconciliation issues with DBPedia !
Right now we are mostly interested in how well the query is structured rather than the correctness of all the values.

- _impressionist artworks displayed in france_
- _italian persons_
- _which museums display baroque artworks ? give me their pictures_
